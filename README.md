# Why Puzzle?

After working to pass a handful of proposals on the Secret Network, it has become painfully obvious the governance experience needs to be made more accessible and users need to be further empowered to stay informed on the state of the network. While stakeholders currently have access to the information regarding proposals from current block explorers like the one hosted by cashmaney, stakeholders still lack a comprehensive resource that really empowers them to more actively participate in the governance process.

To address this, secretnodes.org has worked to launch Puzzle, an open-source project forked from Hubble. Once weâ€™ve deemed Puzzle as stable and production-ready, we plan to use this as a foundational layer to solve for the pain points preventing stakeholders from keeping up with network related events. Through experimentation and collaboration with the community, our mission is to make the process of staying up to date on all network activity as seamless as possible.

Made with :heart: by [secretnodes.org](https://secretnodes.org). Originally forked from the [hubble](https://github.com/figment-networks/hubble) Q4 2019 update.

## How to Setup Puzzle

1. Fork this repo!
1. Generate encrypted credentials with `bin/rails credentials:edit`. Use `config/encrypted_secrets_quickstart.yml` to see what values are needed for what environments. 
1. Setup your instance:
    ```
    export PUZZLE_ADMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
    export PUZZLE_HOST=ip-or-hostname-of-server
    export PUZZLE_RAILS_ENV=production
    export PUZZLE_KEY=~/.ssh/puzzle-key.pem
    export PUZZLE_DOMAIN=puzzle.your.domain
    export PUZZLE_REMOTE_USER=puzzle
    ./setup/bootstrap.sh
    ```
    This automated process is meant for a Ubuntu 18.04 LTS install. We use AWS for this. Puzzle uses HTTPS everywhere, so watch the output for when it asks you to create a DNS record.
1. Assuming that all goes well, there will be a URL you can visit to claim an admin account and setup a password/2FA.
1. In admin, create a new Cosmos chain with the chain name and gaiad RPC/LCD info. Make sure to click 'enable' at the top.
1. Next ssh into the machine, start `screen` and do the initial sync:
    ```
    cd /puzzle/app/current
    bin/rake sync:cosmos:all events:cosmos:all stats:cosmos:all
    ```
    That will take a good long while depending on how long the chain you're syncing has been going for.
1. Once it's done, you will want to install the crontab entries. You can either run `bin/bundle exec whenever --update-crontab` right now, or just deploy again and they'll get installed automatically.

### Development
1. Pull the repo into your local environment
1. Install rbenv using the instructions at https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme. 
1. Make sure you have Ruby 2.5.1 and bundler 2.0 installed on your local machine. 
1. If you don't have postgres installed, run `sudo apt update` and then `sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib ruby-dev nodejs yarn` to install postgres. 
1. Go into `/etc/postgresql/10/main` and open pga_gba.conf in your text editor. (`sudo nano pg_hba.conf`)
1. anywhere you see `local    all           postgres            peer` or any variation of that, edit the last word to `trust`. Some of these might say `peer`, some might say `md5`, etc. Save the file.
1. run `sudo service postgresql restart`. 
1. You'll also need to run `apt install -y libpq-dev` if you're on ubuntu. 
1. Run `bundle install` from the project root.
1. create the database by running `rake db:create` and `rake db:migrate`. `rake db:migrate` might fail the first time but it should succeed on subsequent tries. 
1. run `rails db:seed`. You should get an output with `Admin Created:` followed by a URL. You'll need this in the next step. 
1. run `rails s`. Go to the URL and create a password. 
1. That's it! Your development environment is now set up. 

PS: If your environment is on a server and you need to test on your local machine, you can get a server running on your box and then use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a tunnel. 

## How to Deploy

1. Check to see that you have deployment scripts in /bin. You should see one called deploy-production.sh and one called deploy-staging.sh
1. If you do not have one or both of these scripts, create them and use bin/sample-deploy.sh to set them up (ask jacob if you need help)
1. from the project root folder, run

```
bin/deploy-{RAILS_ENV}.sh
```

Or do it manually:

```
RAILS_ENV=staging DEPLOY_USER=puzzle DEPLOY_HOST=ip-or-hostname DEPLOY_KEYS=~/.ssh/puzzle.pem bin/bundle cap staging deploy
```
